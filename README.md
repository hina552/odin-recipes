# odin-recipes
This project is about creating an html website for my favourite recipes where each one is on its own webpage.
-i'll get used to html boilerplate and the most used tags.
-i'll try to use git and github along with this project
-i'll familliarize myself with links (internal and external ones) and how to link webpages together
